* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
